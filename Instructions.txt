Instructions
I havent completed all the setup steps for your server
i have added all mod types and spawnabletypes into the mod_db folder
All mods have been loaded

you need to add custom trader areas 
you need to edit market prices 
you need to edit types to your liking 
you need to edit spawnable types to your liking
you need to add more strongholds if you want them
Go through config files and expansion files and edit them to your liking lots of great stuff to edit


The Mod "ServerPack1152A" has the stalker style PDA,HUD,spawn select as well as the bbp vailla damage file so vanilla explosive will work




Steps

1)Download Files From link
2)Sub to all mods in list
3)Add mods to server hoster like noramal (Keys file has My ServerPack Key in it)
4)Start server and let run for a few minutes to generate files
5) Go through downloaded file from link and add them into Config and mpmissions

You still have to add custom trader areas using editor loader
(use my trader file as an example) (my file adds one general trader and drug trader and also three strongholds)

Dayz mining requires you to go into editor and place nodes then copy the coords to their .json file
Additional Medical Seems to be causing some issues may want to replace it
Vehicles have not been added as the zoom zoom pack doesnt have a types file
i recommend CARs mod because he has the types and spawnabletypes already loaded in there great mod with over 100 vehicles
